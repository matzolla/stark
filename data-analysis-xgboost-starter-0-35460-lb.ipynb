        "Welcome to the Quora Question Pairs competition! Here, our goal is to identify which questions asked on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/), a quasi-forum website with over 100 million visitors a month, are duplicates of questions that have already been asked. This could be useful, for example, to instantly provide answers to questions that have already been answered. We are tasked with predicting whether a pair of questions are duplicates or not, and submitting a binary prediction against the logloss metric.\n",

This means that we weigh the terms by how **uncommon** they are, meaning that we care more about rare words existing in both questions than common one. This makes sense, as for example we care more about whether the word \"exercise\" appears in both than the word \"and\" - as uncommon words will be more indicative of the content.\n",
